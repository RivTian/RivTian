# Welcome, Stranger

I have [a blog](https://www.cnblogs.com/RioTian) for when I do something mildly interesting, a stat dump to see what my recent activity was, and some trivia.

- ðŸŽ£ I'm looking for collaborators on Rust Projects, and Tauri Front Dev but contributions are welcome anywhere!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Discord @koshakaaa_, email bkcio3 [at] duck.com, or by telex;
  - ðŸ’¬ If you're sending me a message on Discord, please say something that doesn't seem like another scammer
- âš¡ Fun fact: monochrome TIFF images embedded in PDFs are still valid CCITT fax format imagery! Still hoping to make that decoder/encoder pair with my buddy
